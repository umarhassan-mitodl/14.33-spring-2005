{{< anchor "Problem_Set" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Problem Set
------------------------------------------------------

There is one problem set ({{% resource_link 1c08cb45-552f-39cb-ff22-869f3cd69abb "PDF" %}}) in the class, with an associated data file \[tspsimr7172v2.dta ({{% resource_link 08f053ed-5bd5-12fc-24dc-bf6766f65cf5 "DTA" %}})\]. You may find the statistical software package STATA® to be useful in solving the problems. A STATA® tutorial is available in the {{% resource_link 0288693b-72c9-789e-2e7f-9c112dc31701 "study materials" %}} section.

{{< anchor "Research_Paper" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Research Paper
------------------------------------------------------------

The main project will be a paper that should be 10-15 pages of text (12 point Times New Roman with 1 inch margins), plus tables and figures. The paper will report on original economic research that you perform over the course of the semester. There will be a number of opportunities to make presentations on your research throughout the course of the semester.

First draft of the paper is due this week at 5 pm for half the members of each team. This draft will be distributed electronically to the instructors and the members of your research team.  
  
The draft should begin to resemble your full paper. In particular, it should include each of the sections that your final paper will have. For the sections that are not yet complete, you should include an outline of what is coming. It should also include preliminary versions of your tables and figures. Many of you will not have completed the analysis yet and, if you are in this situation, you should include blank tables/figures and/or outlines of what they will look like.   
  
It is essential that you read your classmates' papers once they are posted and be prepared to comment on them in class. Your grade depends on your contribution to your classmates' research projects.  
  
If you turn in a draft for this week, then you will also be expected to make your final presentation. You should plan on presenting your entire project in roughly 12 minutes. There will then be a brief discussion where your fellow students, the instructor, and TA will provide feedback on how to improve your paper. This will be the last opportunity to get feedback in the classroom.
